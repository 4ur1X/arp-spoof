## ARP Spoof / Poisoning
This is a python program that allows attackers to intercept communication between network devices and also communicate with the attacker instead of directly with each other.

Uses of ARP Spoofing tools:
- scan IP addresses and MAC addresses of devices in a network.
- perform 'man-in-the-middle' MITM actions.
- steal credentials and sensitive information, while in transit.
- aid in Denial-of-Service attacks.

Usage syntax: ````python3 arp_spoof.py````
